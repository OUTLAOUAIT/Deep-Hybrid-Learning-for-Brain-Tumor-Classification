# <Deep-Hybrid-Learning-for-Brain-Tumor-Classification>

## Description

In this repository, we will train a deep learning model for brain tumor recognition.

Using deep learning and machine learning has helped to solve many medical issues. Deep learning based computer vision systems have been especially helpful. Such deep learning systems/models can easily recognize different diseases in medecin when we train them on the right dataset. For example, we can train a deep learning model to recognize different types of diseases in human brain.
