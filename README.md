<Deep-Hybrid-Learning-for-Brain-Tumor-Classification>

## Description

In this repository, we will train a deep learning model for brain tumor recognition.

Using deep learning and machine learning has helped to solve many medical issues. Deep learning based computer vision systems have been especially helpful. Such deep learning systems/models can easily recognize different diseases in medecin when we train them on the right dataset. For example, we can train a deep learning model to recognize different types of diseases in human brain.

Most of the time, obtaining large and well-defined datasets to solve such problems becomes an issue. Because for deep learning models to recognize diseases in human body, they will need to train on huge amounts of data. But that does not mean we cannot train a simple deep learning model to check whether such models can work or not.

In fact, in this work, we will use around 3064 images for training a deep learning model. For brain disease recognition, this may not seem much. But as we will see later on, this is a good starting point, which gives us a deep learning model that works fairly well.

## The Brain Tumor Recognition/Classification Dataset
  
  We will use the [Brain Tumor Dataset](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) to train a deep learning model in this work.

The dataset contains images of brain from different types of tumor.

This dataset contains a total of 3064 images with three classes:

Healthy: Leaves with no diseases.
Powdery: These are the leaves that are affected by powdery mildew disease. It is a type of fungal disease that can affect plants based on the time of year. You can read more about the disease here.
Rust: The rust disease can affect different plants. It is a type of fungal disease as well. You may read more about it here.
